## Day 1: January 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: New year, new challenge. Got a little thrown off during the holiday season so starting fresh. Completed regular expressions module of JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification on freeCodeCamp. Worked on fixing portfolio issue.

**Thoughts:**Aiming to knock out at least one module and some actual project work everyday.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
