**Today's Progress**: Built the HTML page for the tribute-page project utilizing HTML5 elements. Began styling with CSS. Will be implementing CSS grid and final styling tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** Slowly figuring out how to properly use all of the HTML5 elements to get the most out of my pages.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
